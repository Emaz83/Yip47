##Simple Summary

Add OmiseGo (OMG) as the next volatile asset to be used as colateral in the delegated Yvaults.

##Abstract 

Add OmiseGo (OMG) as the next volatile asset to be used as colateral in the delegated Yvaults.

##Motivation

Additional delegated Yvault assets are nessecary in order to generate more revenue for the protocol and the ecosystem.  This proposal nominates OMG as the next volatile asset.  As fees on Etherum continue to soar and demand only increases, many investors are looking very closely at 2 layer solutions.  Tether (USDT) recently launched on the OMG Network, so that it could ease congestion in the base layer. This proposal nominates OMG as the next volatile asset to be used as the next collateral.  Other tokens have polled higher, but OMG has already been developed, it is decentralized network that facilitates transparent peer-to-peer transactions in real-time, a scaling solution for finance on the Ethereum network and with 140 million token currently in circulation no more can be minted.

For: ADD OmiseGo (OMG) as the next volatile asset to be used in delegated Yvaults.

Against:  Don't Add OMG.

##Overview

Adding OmiseGo (OMG) as a collateral option to delegated Yvaults will allow OMG holders to deposit token to the vault, which will increase the total locked in value (TLV) and generate a plethura of fees for the protocol.

##Rationale

As many look to escape and offset the ever rising fees, with the demand for Ehterum only rising, OMG will be the scalable solution with the infastructre that can support them.  OMG has already been developed and will be faster to launch as a vault. The OMG community is one of the stronger, more active crypto communities, as opposed to others that are not emmersed in DeFi. No more OMG tokens are able to be minted.  With the addition of OMG to Yvaults, smaller OMG holders will be able to either allow their rewards to compound or claim them on a regular basis at very low gascosts. This model of inclusion will likely draw small and large OMG holders alike, further increasing AUM and driving fee generation for YFI holders.
